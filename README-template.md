## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I reinforced my basic knowledge of html and css and the challenge of trying to deliver a result as close as possible to what was in the reference images, but without having the reference measurements, such as width, height and margins, it was very challenging to get a result as close as possible to what was shown without these measurements and it allowed me to work on my eyesight, the ability to be able to identify the size of a measurement just by looking at it.
